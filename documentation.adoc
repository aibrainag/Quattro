== Tool and Part List
NOTE: Before starting the assembly. Check that you have all the tools and parts in place. We recommend to read this manual once before starting the assembly.

WARNING: Self-manufacturing of the parts is encouraged but can not be officially supported and hence is to your own risk. If you decide to manufacture your own parts then tolerances may vary depending on the machines and methods you are using.

=== Recommended Tools
You will need these tools to assemble the Quattro robot.

* Glue gun
* Soldering iron
* Stuff for robot legs (ex: legos, chopsticks)

=== Step 1. Assemble lower body
==== Step 1.1 Attach servo motor with battery frame
The label of the servo motor should point to the upper part of the robot.
The cable should be on the left.

=== Step 2. Assemble mid body
==== Step 2.1 Solder electronic part to PCB
A printed circuit board (PCB) mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components.
Components are generally soldered onto the PCB to both electrically connect and mechanically fasten them to it.
Intro soldering
==== Step 2.2 Insert knobs
Insert knobs to potentiometer.

Potentiometer is a sensor that is common in our daily lives.
Potentiometers are used to control sound, velocity or frequency.
For example, you can control the intensity of the light or the volume of sound using a Potentiometer.
We will use this sensor to control the phase, frequency, and amplitude of the robot.

- Insert the parts (LED, switch, Potentiometer)
- You can place the solder into the tip of the soldering iron
==== Step 2.3 Label the potentiometer
Attach label the potentiometer. There are four potentiometers. The potentiometers adjust phase, frequency, amplitude of the robot.

=== Step 3. Assemble upperbody
=== Step 4. Integrate mid-body with upper-body
==== Step 6. Attach arduino to PCB

=== Step 5. Integrate mid-body+upper-body with lower body
