== Tool and Part List
NOTE: Before starting the assembly. Check that you have all the tools and parts in place. We recommend to read this manual once before starting the assembly.

WARNING: Self-manufacturing of the parts is encouraged but can not be officially supported and hence is to your own risk. If you decide to manufacture your own parts then tolerances may vary depending on the machines and methods you are using.

=== Recommended Tools
You will need these tools to assemble the Quattro robot.

* Glue gun
* Soldering iron & Solder
* Household material for robot legs (ex: legos, chopsticks)

== Assembly

=== Step 1. Assemble lower body
Tools: Glue gun

==== Step 1.1 Attach servo motor with battery frame
*Components*: 2x servo motors, 2x battery holder

|====

*Instruction*:

1.1.1 place one battery holder in front of you.

1.1.2 On that battery holder, attach two servo motors using the glue gun.

* The label of the servo motor should point to the upper part of the robot.

* The cable should be on the left.

* The angles of the two motor axes are important.

Suggestion: motor axis are aligned 45-90 deg to each other
When you attach motors with frame, you should care following.

*Instructions*

2.1.1 Insert the resistors

2.1.2 Pull the wires of the resistors using a piler

2.1.3 Bend the wires of the resistors so that they are fixed onto the PCB keyboard

2.1.4 Solder the resistors

2.1.5 Cut the excess wires of the resistor

==== Step 2.1 Solder electronic part to PCB
A printed circuit board (PCB) mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components.
Components are generally soldered onto the PCB to both electrically connect and mechanically fasten them to it.
Intro soldering

- Insert the parts (LED, switch, Potentiometer)
- You can place the solder into the tip of the soldering iron


==== Step 2.2 Insert knobs
Insert knobs to potentiometer.

Potentiometer is a sensor that is common in our daily lives.
Potentiometers are used to control sound, velocity or frequency.
For example, you can control the intensity of the light or the volume of sound using a Potentiometer.
We will use this sensor to control the phase, frequency, and amplitude of the robot.

==== Step 2.3 Label the potentiometer
Attach label the potentiometer. There are four potentiometers. The potentiometers adjust phase, frequency, amplitude of the robot.

=== Step 3. Assemble upperbody

==== Step 3.1 Attach arduino to SO(2)-walker board

==== Step 4.1 Add battery to the frame

==== Step 4.2 Attach the SO(2)-walker board and Arduino to the frame

It is body of robot.

==== Step 4.3 Attach ultrasonic sensor cable to SO(2)-walker board

Ultrasonic sesnor has 4 pin (vcc,gnd,trig,echo).
You should connect those pint to SO(2)-walker board.
