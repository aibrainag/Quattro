== Tool and Part List
NOTE: Before starting the assembly. Check that you have all the tools and parts in place. We recommend to read this manual once before starting the assembly.

WARNING: Self-manufacturing of the parts is encouraged but can not be officially supported and hence is to your own risk. If you decide to manufacture your own parts then tolerances may vary depending on the machines and methods you are using.

=== Recommended Tools
You will need these tools to assemble the Quattro robot.

* Glue gun
* Soldering iron & Solder
* Cable cutting nippers 
* Plier
* Household material for robot legs (ex: legos, chopsticks)
*

== Assembly

=== Step 1. Assemble lower body
Tools: Glue gun
==== Step 1.1 Attach servo motor with battery frame

When you attach motors with frame, you should care following.

- The label of the servo motor should point to the upper part of the robot.
- The cable should be on the left.
- The angles of the two motor axes are important.

Suggestion: motor axis are aligned 45-90 deg to each other

=== Step 2. Assemble mid body
Tools: Solder, soldering iron, 

==== Step 2.1 Solder resistors

==== Step 2.2 Solder capacitors

check +- of black capacitor (100uf)

==== Step 2.3 Solder pinhead for battery connection

after soldering, band pinhead

==== Step 2.4 Solder LEDs

check +- of LEDs 

==== Step 2.5 Solder tatile switch & slide switch

==== Step 2.6 Solder pinhead sockets for arduino

==== Step 2.7 Solder pinhead for servo motors 

==== Step 2.8 Prepare and solder potentiometer 
- Bend the supporting mechanism of the potentiometer inward 
- Bend the input mechanism of the potentiometer outwards 
- Solder the potentiometer onto the PCB board 
 


==== Step 2.1 Solder electronic part to PCB
A printed circuit board (PCB) mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components.
Components are generally soldered onto the PCB to both electrically connect and mechanically fasten them to it.
Intro soldering

- Insert the parts (LED, switch, Potentiometer)
- You can place the solder into the tip of the soldering iron


==== Step 2.2 Insert knobs
Insert knobs to potentiometer.

Potentiometer is a sensor that is common in our daily lives.
Potentiometers are used to control sound, velocity or frequency.
For example, you can control the intensity of the light or the volume of sound using a Potentiometer.
We will use this sensor to control the phase, frequency, and amplitude of the robot.

==== Step 2.3 Label the potentiometer
Attach label the potentiometer. There are four potentiometers. The potentiometers adjust phase, frequency, amplitude of the robot.

=== Step 3. Assemble upperbody

==== Step 3.1 Attach arduino to SO(2)-walker board

Attach arduino to SO(2)-walker board.

You should care direction of arduino.

==== Step 3.2 Attach the servo motor cable

You should care direction of motor cable.

=== Step 4. Integrate mid-body with upper-body

==== Step 4.1 Add battery to the frame

==== Step 4.2 Attach the SO(2)-walker board and Arduino to the frame

It is body of robot.

==== Step 4.3 Attach ultrasonic sensor cable to SO(2)-walker board

Ultrasonic sesnor has 4 pin (vcc,gnd,trig,echo).
You should connect those pint to SO(2)-walker board.

=== Step 5. Integrate mid-body+upper-body with lower body

==== Step 5.1 Build robot legs

You can build robot legs with legos and any stuff you want
