== Tool and Part List
NOTE: Before starting the assembly. Check that you have all the tools and parts in place. We recommend to read this manual once before starting the assembly.

WARNING: Self-manufacturing of the parts is encouraged but can not be officially supported and hence is to your own risk. If you decide to manufacture your own parts then tolerances may vary depending on the machines and methods you are using.

=== Recommended Tools
You will need these tools to assemble the Quattro robot.

* Glue gun
* Soldering iron & Solder
* Household material for robot legs (ex: legos, chopsticks)

|====

*Instruction*:

1.1.1 place one battery holder in front of you.

1.1.2 On that battery holder, attach two servo motors using the glue gun.

* The label of the servo motor should point to the upper part of the robot.

* The cable should be on the left.

* The angles of the two motor axes are important.

* Suggestion: motor axis are aligned 45-90 deg to each other
When you attach motors with frame, you should care following.

1.1.3 Attach the remaining battery holder onto the two servo motors+battery holder.
